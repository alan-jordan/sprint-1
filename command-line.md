I would describe the command line as a way of telling a computer to do things using text.

#10 Terminal commands
1. rm - Stands for remove. This allows you to remove a file.
2. cp - Stands for copy. Allows you to copy a file from one location to another. Once you have copied the file, the original will still be in place.
3. cat - Stands for concatenate. Allows you to display the contents of a file on the command line.
4. mv - Stands for move. Allows you to move a file from one location to another. Once you have moved the file, the original will no longer be in it's original location.
5. ls - Stands for list. Lists the contents of a directory and prints it's contents to the command line.
6. pwd - Stands for present working directory. Prints your current directory to the command line. For example, foo@localhost > pwd, might give you /home/foo if you were currently in Foo's home directory.
7. touch - Will create an empty file for you to use later. For example, touch /tmp/test would create an empty file called test in the tmp directory.
8. cd - Stands for change directory. Allows you to move about the computer using the command line. cd /home/foo/Downloads would take you to Foo's Downloads folder.
9. wc - Stands for word count. Allows you to count how many lines or words are in a file and print this out to the command line.
10. mkdir - Stands for make directory. Allows you to create a directory on the computer.
